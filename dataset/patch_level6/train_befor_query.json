Irregular nuclear membranes are also observed, with some nuclei having jagged or lobulated contours, deviating from the smooth, round membrane of normal cell nuclei. \n\nThe cancerous region is primarily localized within the central part of the image, with a dense aggregation of abnormal cells clearly distinct from the adjacent areas. This distinction may explain the malignancy compared to the surrounding normal tissue, where cells would typically show more uniformity in size, shape, and nuclear appearance. In summary, these morphological features strongly suggest that the marked area has undergone malignant transformation.",

Additionally, there is a noticeably high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, suggesting increased cellular density with nuclei occupying a greater proportion of the cell space. The nuclei in this region are hyperchromatic, meaning they are darker stained, indicating increased DNA content typical of cancerous cells. Furthermore, there are irregular nuclear membranes, reflecting atypical nuclear morphology often seen in malignant transformations.
